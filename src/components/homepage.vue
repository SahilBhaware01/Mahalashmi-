       Back in 1962, the visionary, ambitious and enterprising team of Shri. Hukmichand Chordia and Late Mrs. Kamalbai
       Hukmichand Chordia launched a new line of spices from a modest, home-based set-up. Disillusioned with the state
       of the spices market in Western India, the couple decided to become masters of their own destiny and revolutionize
       the way spices were manufactured in the region. Right through our existence, we have placed paramount importance 
       on developing and nurturing deep and lasting relationships. At Suhana, spices are not a simple commodity, but a 
       means to satiate the souls of our customers and create an everlasting bond that lasts for generations. We ensure 
       our customers enjoy ‘Mazaa Aa Gaya’ moments with our products.
